# Hi there 👋, I'm Siddhant!- call sign Sid!

## 🚀 Engineering Tomorrow's Technology Today

With a **Master's in Computer Science** from **Indiana University**, I specialize in building scalable, efficient systems that impact real-world operations. I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer at Gradient Startup**, where I focus on **backend systems** and **API integrations**—basically anything that makes your app tick without burning down the server.

### 🛠 What I Do:
- **Backend Development**: I do **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Microservices**. Whether it's integrating complex systems or optimizing code performance, I'm on it.
- **Cloud Architectures**: Proficient in **AWS**, **Firebase**, **GCP**. I know how to make sure your app stays up in the cloud and doesn't float away.
- **Full-Stack Work**: From **ReactJS/Native** on the front to **Node.js** on the back, I've got the skills to deliver end-to-end solutions—because who doesn't like a little bit of frontend, right?
- **Machine Learning & AI**: When I’m not busy breaking the laws of backend development, I like to read about **AI/ML Progressions**, because predicting stock performance with 85% accuracy?- Yeah, I did that.
- **System Designs & Distributed Systems**: Designed robust architectures and pushed scalability while avoiding what I call "the log-everything-until-production-crashes" design pattern (learned that the hard way).

### 💻 Some Projects I'm Proud Of:
- **SERS - Speech Emotion Recognition System**, - **BookGenie - Library Management System**,  **UniMatch- A University Recommendation System**, **Travel-Wiz- A Tour Management System**. 
  
### 📈 Experience:
- **Gradient Startup (Software Engineer)**: Designing APIs, Firebase Cloud Functions, and handling the complexities of real-time data flow without making the cloud cry.
- **Jabil (Software Engineer Intern)**: Scaled analytics dashboards on AWS—saving 60+ hours of work per month. Oh, and I even managed to leave the server standing. 😎
- **WebSatva Startup (Full-Stack Developer)**: Boosted operational efficiency by 18% while making sure the backend is bulletproof (figuratively, of course).

### 🌍 Open to Opportunities:
- Looking for roles where I can leverage my skills in **backend development**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **machine learning**.
- **Relocation?** You name the place, I’ll be there (as long as they have Wi-Fi).

⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m the guy who learned never to push to production on a Friday. But hey, if you're feeling adventurous, maybe we can break the rules together. 😜
